# Generating test data

## Coordinate tests

The input data used in the coordinate tests was generated using the random number generator functions in the [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) python library.

The expected results used in the coordinate tests were calculated using the coordinate conversion functions found in the [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) python library.
