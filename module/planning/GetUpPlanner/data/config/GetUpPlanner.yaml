# How many consecutive frames we have to be at recovery levels before triggering a getup
count: 30
# The angle from standing upright to trigger a getup (e.g. lying down would be 90 degrees)
angle: 60.0 * pi / 180.0
# In order to trigger a getup the total rotation rate from the gyro must be less than this value
gyro: 1.0
# The mean value of the accelerometer at rest (should be acceleration due to gravity)
g: 9.8
# In order to trigger a getup the magnitude of accelerometer minus g must be less than this value
acc: 10.0
