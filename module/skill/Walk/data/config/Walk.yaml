walk:
  # Time for one complete step (in seconds).
  period: 0.325
  step:
    # Maximum step limits in x and y (in meters), and theta (in radians).
    limits: [0.5, 0.1, 0.4]
    # Step height (in meters)
    height: 0.055
    # Lateral distance in meters between feet (how spread apart the feet should be)
    width: 0.19
    # Ratio of the step_period where the foot should be at its highest point, between [0 1].

  torso:
    # Torso height (in meters)
    height: 0.45
    # Torso pitch (in radians)
    pitch: 22 * pi / 180
    # Torso offset from the planted foot [x,y,z] (in meters), at time = torso_sway_ratio*step_period
    sway_offset: [0, 0.09, 0]
    # Ratio of the step_period where the torso should be at its maximum sway, between [0 1]
    sway_ratio: 0.1
    # Determines where to position the torso at the end of the step using a ratio of the next step placement.
    # For example, a value of [0.5, 0.5, 1] would position the torso halfway between the planted and swing foot and with
    # torso yaw rotation equal to swing foot yaw
    final_position_ratio: [0.5, 0.5, 1]
