  # Lens: Lensagon BF10M19828S118C
  # Camera: FLIR BFS-U3-13Y3C-C

  # Theoretical normalised focal length
  # Lens Focal Length = 1.98mm
  # Camera Pixel Size = 4.8µm
  # focal_length / (camera_pixel_size * width)
  # 1.98mm / (4.8µm * 1280px) = 0.322265625

  # NOTE: all lens parameters are based on a full size image (without width/height/offset values)

  # Lens projection type
  projection: EQUIDISTANT
  # Normalised focal length: focal length in pixels / image width
  focal_length: 0.34668243830134987
  # Normalised image centre offset: pixels from centre to optical axis / image width
