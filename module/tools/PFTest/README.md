# PFTest

## Description

Implements a van Der Pol oscillator model to test the PF implementation. The model implementation
is based on the MATLAB article [Nonlinear State Estimation Using Unscented Kalman Filter and Particle Filter](https://au.mathworks.com/help/ident/examples/nonlinear-state-estimation-using-unscented-kalman-filter.html).

## Usage

Run the `pftest` role and check the outputs printed to the screen.

## Emits

No external emits.

## Dependencies

Eigen and the PF utillity.
