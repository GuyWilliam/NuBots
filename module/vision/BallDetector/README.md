# BallDetector

## Description

The BallDetector module performs post-processing on the output of the VisualMesh to determine where balls are in the image, if any. If there are no balls, it will emit an empty `Balls` message.

## Usage

Add this module to get positions of balls, given the required messages are present.

## Consumes

- `message::vision::GreenHorizon` which contains points that represent the green horizon, and the Visual Mesh output. The Visual Mesh output is used to create the ball clusters and the green horizon is used to remove balls above the horizon.
- `message::support::FieldDescription` which contains parameters that define the structure and size of the field. This is used to determine if a detection of a ball is likely to be a ball.

## Emits

- `message::vision::Balls` which contains an array of `message::vision::Ball` messages, which contains information such as position and covariance of the ball. Can be empty.
