lens:
  # Lens: Webots based on Lensagon BF10M19828S118C
  # Camera: Webots based on FLIR BFS-U3-13Y3C-C

  # Theoretical normalised focal length
  # Lens Focal Length = 1.98mm
  # Focal length in pixels = 320
  # focal length / image width = 320 / 640 = 0.5

  # NOTE: all lens parameters are based on a full size image (without width/height/offset values)

  # Lens projection type
  projection: RECTILINEAR
  # Normalised focal length: focal length in pixels / image width
  focal_length: 0.5
  # Normalised image centre offset: pixels from centre to optical axis / image width
  centre: [0, 0]
  # The polynomial distortion coefficients for the lens
  k: [0, 0]
  # The angular diameter that the lens covers (the area that light hits on the sensor) or auto for the entire sensor
  fov: 90 * pi / 180
  # The homogenous transform from the rigid platform this camera is attached to to its optical location
